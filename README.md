# MorePlayers
A R.E.P.O. mod that allows you to decrease or increase the max player cap.
# Important note
I am no longer working on this mod, so I won't be updating it anytime soon.

All of the code here is 100% ok to take, especially if you want to create a better version of MorePlayers.
# How to install
It's recommended to install this mod with a mod manager like Gale or Thunderstore Mod Manager, follow the instructions [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/zelofi/MorePlayers/).
